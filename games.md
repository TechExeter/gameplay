<h3>Joypad arcade</h3>
<p>Our friends at London based Joypad Arcade are coming down with their retro hardware to give us 12 stations of gaming goodness, placed throughout Exeter Phoenix</p>
<p>We know everyone has their favourites... Rather break out the special moves in Street Fighter II over Streets of Rage? Prefer to hit the track with Mario Kart or Micro Machines? Sooner settle old scores with Goldeneye or Super Smash Bros.? Whatever your tastes, we should have you covered!</p>
