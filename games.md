					<h3>Joypad Arcade</h3>
				</header>
				<p>Our friends at London based Joypad Arcade are coming down with their <strong>retro consoles</strong> to give us 12 stations of gaming goodness, which will be placed throughout the Exeter Phoenix. SNES, MegaDrive, GameCube, Dreamcast, N64, PlayStation - we've got them all!</p>
				<p>We know everyone has their favourite consoles and games - Prefer to break out the special moves in Street Fighter II over Streets of Rage? Rather hit the track with Mario Kart or Micro Machines? Sooner settle old scores with Goldeneye or Super Smash Bros.? Whatever your tastes, we should have you covered!</p>

					<h3>Codex Bash</h3>
				</header>
				<div class="boxed">Location: 1st Floor / Meeting Room</div>

				<p>A game installation designed by Alistair Aitcheson to mix physical movement with teamwork, communication and problem-solving.</p>

				<p>One physical space, four big buttons and codes to be cracked! Players must use clues scattered around the room to uncover a sequence of button presses, and run around to bash the buttons in the right order.</p>

				<p>You may have to flip through maps, pick apart circuit diagrams or rifle through a book of spy photos, but one thing’s for certain: the best codebreakers work as a team!</p>
