	<h3 id="rebellion">Rebellion Playground, hosted by Scratchworks Theatre Company</h3>
	<code>Location: 1st Floor / Dance Studio</code> <a href="#rebellion" class="button small special">Recommended for ages 16+</a>
	<p>Step into the Rebellion Playground; a place for game changers, rule breakers, and balloon poppers!</p>
	<p>This is a new interactive experience for anyone who wants to see change, big or small but doesn't know where to begin. Come and play, bend the rules, be provoked and start a discussion.<br/>
The Playground will be inclusive for all, whether you would prefer to fully participate or to observe. The Scratchworks team are part game masters/ part revolution seekers, providing a series of provocations and tasks to the participants who have agency to accept, refuse or even revolt. </p>

	<ul>
		<li>Slot 1 : 11.00 - 12.30</li>
		<li>Slot 2 : 13.00 - 14.30</li>
		<li>Slot 2 : 15.00 - 16.30</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Spaces are limited to 18 people per slot. Due to the <em>rebellious</em> nature of the workshop, under 16s need to be accompanied by an adult.</p>
