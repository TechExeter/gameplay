	<blockquote><strong>GAME>PLAY</strong> is a brand new one-day gaming festival for Exeter - bringing together playable art, retro gaming, indie games and theatre shows together under one roof.</blockquote>

	<h3>We think Exeter needs to <em>play</em> more!</h3>
	<p>We've got some amazing play/gaming centres in Exeter - escape rooms, board game caf√©s, tabletop boardgaming shops, and a games development course at Exeter College - so we thought it would be a good idea to bring together everyone for a festival of playability!</p>

	<h3>GAME>PLAY 2019</h3>
	<p>We only had a short time and tiny budget to put together this event, but we've managed to put together a day full of activities - two theatre shows, workshops, plus retro and indie games showcases. But we want to do more - so if you enjoy what we've done this year, we'd love to hear your thoughts on how to make the event better for next year!</p>
	
	<h3>TechExeter</h3>
	<p>This event has been curated by Kris Sum of TechExeter CIC - a non-profit community interest company. With over 1000+ members on meetup.com, dozens of events every year, plus it's annual tech conference, TechExeter is at the heart of the local tech community.</p>
